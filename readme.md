# Neighborhood Map
### How the project is organized
1. **index.html** houses all the HTML code with data binding
2. The **js** folder has two javascript files, _app.js_ and _map.js_. The former houses all the knockout code, and the latter holds the Google Maps API code
3. A css file _style.js_ in the **css** folder

### How to run the project
(Two ways)
1. Open the **index.html** file in any browser and use the application normally.
2. Start an HTTP server in the project folder. One option is [**httpster**](https://simbco.github.io/httpster/).
